## YAUTF

YAUTF, Yet Another Unit Testing Framework, is a small, lightweight unit testing framework for C++. It aims to deliver a lightweight solution to the problem of standardizable and maintainable unit testing output.

Please note that as a LGPL v3 library, `yautf` will require you to supply the source to YAUTF or any modifications on request by your users.

### Contributions

Contributions to this project do not require copyright assignment, but by committing and merging into the master branch, you agree to license your commits under the LGPL v3 or later.

## Loading

YAUTF is designed to be loaded in one of two ways:
- Statically compiled alongside your source
- Dynamically linked against (see `yautf.cc` for pre-defined types that are compatible with dynamic linking)

Either way, it's as simple as including `yautf.hh` into the file that contains your unit test. `yautf.cc` exists in order to provide template definitions for the compiler for a number of types, and isn't anything that needs to be worried about, unless you plan to add more predefined types to this file and compile it as a shared object.

An up-to-date shared object will be provided in the releases section of this repository.

## Using YAUTF

YAUTF contains three classes, `TestManager`, `Test`, and `TestResult`. Each class is designed to specifically depend on the implementation of the other, for ease of building and importing. In general usage, only `TestManager` and `Test` should be referenced in code outside of the `yautf` namespace.

Here is a typical usage of `yautf`:

```
yautf::TestManager<int>* mgmt = new yautf::TestManager<int>();
std::string testName = "My Test"
int expectedValue = 1;
int actualValue = myObject.DoStuff();
yautf::Test<int>* tst = new yautf::Test<int>(testName, expectedValue);
tst->SetActual(actualValue);
mgmt->LoadTest(tst);
mgmt->VerifyTests();
mgmt->DisplayAllResults();
delete mgmt;
```

To break this down in chunks, we observe the following:

```
yautf::TestManager<int>* mgmt = new yautf::TestManager<int>();
```

First, we instantiate a new `TestManager` object to hold all of our `Test` objects. This object is a template, and will require the passing of a `typename`. This `typename` is propagated down to the `Test` objects it holds, and the `TestResult` object at the very bottom of the hierarchy.

```
std::string testName = "My Test"
int expectedValue = 1;
```

Here, we're just setting some expected values to pass to the constructor of `Test`. `testName` signifies the name of the case being executed, and will be displayed as output. `expectedValue` signifies the expected value, and will also be displayed as output, but is also used in the comparison against the actual value.

```
int actualValue = myObject.DoStuff();
```

With this statement, we are calling a hypothetical object in your code, `myObject` and invoking the method we wish to test: `DoStuff()`. Please note that as of current writing, `yautf` does not manage the *execution* of your test cases, only *output* and *comparison*.

```
yautf::Test<int>* tst = new yautf::Test<int>(testName, expectedValue);
tst->SetActual(actualValue);
```

In these lines, we are creating a new conceptual test, as a `Test` object, and passing our desired case name and expected value. The following call to the `Test` class' `SetActual` sets the actual value (but does not yet compare it!)

```
mgmt->LoadTest(tst);
```

This particular line loads the `Test` object into the `TestManager` instance. Internally, `TestManager` uses a `std::vector<T>` of the type `T` you define during instantiation. Note that the type of the `Test` **must** match the type of the `TestManager`. The amount of tests a `TestManager` can hold is only limited by the same limiting factors as the `MAX_CAPACITY` of `std::vector<T>`.

```
mgmt->VerifyTests();
```

In this portion, `VerifyTests` is invoked to cycle through all `Test` objects held in the `Test`-containing `std::vector` of `TestManager`.

```
mgmt->DisplayAllResults();
```

This section of the code tells the `TestManager` instance to loop through all `Test` objects held within the `Test`-containing `std::vector` of `TestManager`. This produces output of the following form:

```
TEST RESULTS:

For test: My Test
RESULT: SUCCESS
Expected: 1
Actual: 1
```

This is designed to be uniform for all tests, to ensure maximum trawlability by metrics scripts and other methods of tracking test cases.

```
delete mgmt;
```

And finally, we delete the `TestManager` instance for good housekeeping.
